First created directory for the project. Then created new virtualenv for python/django and finally activated the env.

    $ mkdir harkka
    $ virtualenv --system-site-paclages -p python3 env/
    $ source env/bin/activate

Next installed Django with pip. Made a .txt file to from which the pip gets the stuff that needs to be installed, in this case only django. ( Don't really know the reason for the use of a separate file, but as it's customary to do so, i did it this way. )

Started my new django project 'ttrdjango'. 

    $ django-admin startproject ttrdjango

This created ttrdjango folder with ttrdjango-folder (and other files in that, not going to details what files here. ) and a manage.py file in it.

And at last started the server and visited the 127.0.0.1:8000 to see the frontpage.

    $./manage.py runserver

Worth pointing out that it's more convinient to always operate on the folder ( dir.level ) where the manage.py file is located.
